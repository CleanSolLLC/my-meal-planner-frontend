# My-Meal-Planner-Frontend

My Meal Planner Frontend is a front end (client) application that integrates with My Meal Planner Backend (server).
My Meal Planner is broken down in to two components. A search box that allows the user to input search criteria by asking a question about a particular food item. The user can enter a search criteria such as how many carbs are in a slice of bread or how many calories are in a serving of chocolate chip cookies. If the data is found in the RapidApi Recipes Database, a response will be returned otherwise an alert box is generated stating "Answer Not Found Please Try Again".

The second part of the application requires the user to input a generalized food or recipe search followed by several optional parameters including the number of recipes returned; food type, cuisine, diet, food intolerance and any ingredient that the user would like excluded from the recipe. If the recipe is found, a recipe card is generated otherwise an alert box is generated stating "Recipe Not Found Please Try Again".
